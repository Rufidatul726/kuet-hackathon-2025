Recipe Name: Mediterranean Quinoa Salad

Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water or vegetable broth
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 cucumber, diced
- 1 bell pepper (red or yellow), diced
- 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
- 1 cup chickpeas (canned, drained and rinsed)
- 1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and halved
- 1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled (optional for vegan)
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh mint, chopped (optional)

Instructions:
- Rinse the quinoa under cold water to remove any bitterness.
- In a medium saucepan, combine the quinoa and water (or vegetable broth). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
- Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is fluffy and the liquid is absorbed.
- Remove from heat and let it sit covered for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.
- While the quinoa is cooking, chop the cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, and red onion.
- Rinse and drain the chickpeas, and chop the parsley and mint.
- In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, chickpeas, olives, feta cheese (if using), parsley, and mint.
- Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.
- Let the salad sit for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. You can serve it immediately or refrigerate it for a couple of hours.
- Serve chilled or at room temperature.
